# e•gif•phany
a dynamically generated web page of aesthetically pleasing gifs and images based on art and design. Basically really pretty gifs.
Gifs based on keywords are generated dynamically using the Giphy API and users can add a keyword to display new gifs. The background changes randomly using Unsplash's source using their built in API.


 
## Getting Started 

A modern web browser is recommeded for using this app. Thanks to Bootstrap, this app is fully responsive and viewable on mobile devices. To use the app simply click on a keyword located under the search bar. Alternatively you can enter your own keyword into the search query and add it as a keyword on the page. Each keyword to load up to 14 images on the page. The images are displayed in black/white and slightly blurred upon being loaded. They will animate and clear up upon hover.
